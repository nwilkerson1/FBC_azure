    <h2>Worship Leader - Eva Kroon Pike</h2>
    <img class="img" src="./Images/picture2.jpg" alt="Worship leader">
    <p>Hi! My name is Eva Kroon Pike and I am the new worship leader for First Baptist Church Mulberry. At 6 weeks old I was adopted into a loving family that had been waiting and praying for a baby for 6 years.  These circumstances nurtured me into the singer/songwriter/worship leader I am today.  Before being called to Mulberry I have served in several local churches as worship leader and before that I had the wonderful opportunity to travel and share my music through concerts and radio throughout several cities and states.  I have 2 albums titled “Grace That Chose Me” & “Love Is All About You” as well as a Christmas single “Christmas Revolution”.  Through music I want more than ever to point people to God who sent His son to die so that everyone who believes in Him will live eternally. “If I’m anything close to what I’m meant to be, I owe it to the hands of Grace that chose me”.  I have also been married to my husband, Jonny, for 16 years and we have 4 boys; Jonathan (13), Corey (8), Bentley (4), and Lyric (2) and a baby girl, Abi Gail, (born in February of 2022).  We are excited to be at First Baptist Church Mulberry and cannot wait to see what God has in store for our family and the church. </p>
